# LoveStory Duvik Page

This project is a personal and creative website built as part of a course assignment. The goal was to create a complete static website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The website introduces Duvik Rosen, a 67-year-old widower from Herzliya who is a mentor to young entrepreneurs, a volunteer at a dog rescue organization, and a blogger who writes about new beginnings and late-life love.

## Folder Structure

- index.html  
  This is the main HTML file of the website. It is written in Hebrew and uses right-to-left (RTL) direction. It includes all the sections of the site, such as About, Gallery, Song, Quiz, Contact Form, and more.

- css/  
  This folder contains all the stylesheets used in the project. The CSS is organized by category:
  - main.css – General styling rules applied across the whole website.
  - layout.css – Handles the layout structure, positioning, and grid settings.
  - typography.css – Defines font families, sizes, colors, and headings.
  - components.css – Contains styles for specific UI components like buttons, modals, quiz layout, and emoji picker.

- js/  
  This folder includes JavaScript files. Currently, it contains:
  - script.js – Adds interactivity to the site, including the like button, quiz logic, and fun fact functionality.

- imgs/  
  This folder holds all image assets used in the project:
  - zeevfirstpic.png – Main profile image shown at the top of the page.
